# DimeWise

DimeWise is a gamified personal finance simulator designed to help teens and young adults build financial literacy in a safe, simulated environment. Players manage income, expenses, debt, savings, and investments â€” and face real-world challenges â€” while watching their net worth grow.

This project is in the works and will be updated as needed!
